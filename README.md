# Laboratory Work â„–1: NER 

This repository contains code, that allow to fine-tune `distilbert-base-cased` model on `CoNLL-2003` dataset. 

* To perform EDA, preprocessing, and fine-tuning, run `solution.ipynb`.
* If you want to infer fine-tuned model, use fine-tuned weights in `fine_tuned_model` directory.

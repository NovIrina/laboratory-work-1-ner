# Laboratory Work â„–1: NER 

This repository contains code, that allow to fine-tune `distilbert-base-cased` model on `CoNLL-2003` dataset. 

* To perform EDA, preprocessing, and fine-tuning, run `solution.ipynb`.
* If you want to infer fine-tuned model, download `config.json`, `model.safetensors`, and `training_args.bin` from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FiGtgrQT6FBE2zex18Wb5As8jicdzVlb?usp=sharing) and paste them into the `fine_tuned_model` directory.
